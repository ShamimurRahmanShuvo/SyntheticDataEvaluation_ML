# SyntheticDataEvaluation_ML

Machine learning codes for the synthetic data evalation tool. It contains the following machine learning algorithms (both supervised and unsupervised) 
on two different original datasets along with their synthetic data:

  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Decision Tree
  3. Random Forest
  4. K-Nearest Neighbor
  5. Support Vector Machine
  6. K- Means Clustering
  7. One class SVM
  8. Isolation Forest
  9. Local Outlier Factor
  10. Neive Bayes
  
The evaluation includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and PR curve. The algorithms were implemented using Sci-kit learn.
